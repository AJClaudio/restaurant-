# Project - Create your own predictive model

Predictive models are used across industries to analyze and make predictions about data. From sports to beauty products to app usage, predictive models provide individuals and businesses with data to make informed decisions.

Throughout this module, you have learned how to program both supervised and unsupervised learning models. In this final project, you will create your own! Throughout this project, you will work through activities to complete the following steps:

1. Choose a dataset.
2. Determine which algorithm is the best fit. Based on the dataset you choose, you will need to figure out which algorithm to use. This will require you to get to know your data and your goals! Is there a linear correlation between variables? Are you looking for numerical value or a label/category? Do you know the labels or do you need the model to create them for you?
- Do some tests with matplotlib and visualize your data.  Does it provide a good correlation?  Why or why not?
3. Program your model. Once you have chosen your type of model, itâ€™s time to create it! In this step, you will write a program that fits your chosen model to the data. Your program and output will be specific to the model you choose.  
4. Analyze and present your findings. An important part of creating predictive models is being able to communicate the results. In this final step of the project, you will present your findings using slides or an infographic. Your product should include the following components:
- Your reasoning for the algorithm you chose
> The reason we chose this algorithm is because the data that we are using is strictly numerical and we are looking for an numerical output in order to achieve a result. This means that linear regression would be the most optimal choice as it would create an equation to predict.
- An explanation and analysis of the output of your model: What results did your model produce? What do they mean?
> With the input of the incentive cost and the total project amount that the city is giving these small businesses, the output that we are trying to get is the amount of projected jobs that this increased funding would produce. Our model produced that there was a low correlation between the incentive amount and project costs to the predicted amount of jobs it would create.
- A prediction based on your model
> Incentive Amount: 150000.0 Total Project Cost: 310000.0 Actual: 30.0 Predicted: 7.35. Based on our model, a business with $6800 in incentive money and $16372 worth of total project would create 1 Job. In reality this would create no jobs.

- A summary of the accuracy of your model
> The R^2 value of our model is 0.18 which isn't very accurate meaning that there is very weak correlation between the incentive amounts and total project costs of an investment to a small business and the amount of jobs that it would aspire to produce.
- Real world implications
> The implications of this data means that the pure numerical amount of money that is being given to small business will not directly lead to an increase in jobs. Further variables that may affect whether or not jobs will be available would be the location of the business as well as the unemployment or economic level of the district it is in.
